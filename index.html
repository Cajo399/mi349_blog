        <p>Hello all, thank you for taking the time to check out my blog! I'm very excited to be writing my first blog post ever. In this post I want to talk about golf. I love golf, it's really fun to get outside and be on the golf course, maybe even crack a couple of cold ones with the boys. There's no better feeling than hitting your driver pure off the face of the club and watching it go down the middle of the fairway. Or perhaps when you hit a beautiful putt that rolls end over end on the perfect line and drops perfectly in the hole. Golf, while fun, can be pretty frustrating. The thing that makes it the most frustrating is that you know you are capable of hitting a good shot, but doing that consistently is quite difficult for all players. The mid range shots are also one of the hardest to hit. Sure, anyone can rip their driver. But it's from 150 yards in that even pro players can struggle with. Anyways, I would like to share some of furhtest drives that I have been able to hit during this years amazing and beatuiful golf season. Even though the season is still not over it's close to being so.</p>
